Hello all, 

This is the simple login and registration form using C++.

Code Description:

This program contains Main menu which includes four options namely 

1.Login            - Asks, user to enter the username and password to check whether the username and password present in database. If it's present it will print welcome message :) else it will print chech the password and username.

(note: Here, I used a file system for database not a realtime database system)

2.Register         - Here it helps to register the username and password in the filesystem.

3.Forgot password  - If the user forgot their password means it will retreive their password with the help of username id.

4.Exit             - It ends the program.

Thank you...!
